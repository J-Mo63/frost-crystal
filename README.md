# Frost Crystal: The coolest Crystal API framework

Frost Crystal is a barebones, modular API framework build with [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org)... and it's super cool.

Its structure has been built out to be naturally quite opinionated. That being said however, the project's logic is easy enough to follow and can easily be modified to suit your needs.
